# Progress: Playful Pause

## What Works
- Home page with animated header, activity grid, and Surprise Me
- Activities: Color Breathing, Doodle Play, Creative Prompt, Mood Garden, Sound Shapes, Whimsy Wishes
- Local persistence: personalization keys and saved Creative Spark response; Mood Garden state
- Tailwind theming + custom animations; shadcn/ui components
- Routing with 404 catch-all

## What's Left to Build
- Accessibility pass across activities (keyboard order, focus states)
- Clarify or remove background music toggle in `Index` (no `<audio>` present)
- Additional wishes/content datasets as needed

## Known Issues and Limitations
- No server sync; data is per-browser
- Heavy inline SVG/animation could impact very low-end devices (generally OK)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Kept app fully client-side with minimal persistence
- Removed experimental Snake game to keep focus on core joyful activities
- Introduced Memory Bank for durable project context
