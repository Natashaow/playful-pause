# Product Context: Playful Pause

## Problem Statement
People need quick, pressure-free ways to reset during the day. Most wellness apps optimize for streaks or depth; Playful Pause optimizes for tiny, joyful moments with no pressure.

## User Experience Goals
- Gentle, illustrated experiences with soft colors and subtle motion.
- One-tap entry and Back; everything feels lightweight.
- Sensible defaults; optional persistence only when it helps (e.g., saved Creative Spark response, personalization hints).

## Success Metrics
- App loads without console errors in latest Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge.
- Time-to-first-interaction is fast; animations remain smooth.
- Activities are usable with keyboard and pointer; aria labels present on key actions.
